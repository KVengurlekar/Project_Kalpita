File Sharing App
we need to develop a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to upload, download, and
manage files. The application should provide a secure and user-friendly platform for sharing fi les while maintaining data
integrity and confidentiality.
Key Requirements:
1. Develop a GUI using Python's tkinter library to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for file sharing
fu ncti analities.
2.1mplement file upload and download features, allowing users to upload files to the server and download files from the
server as needed.
3.1 nclude user authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage files within the
application.
4. Ensure data encryption during f ile transmission to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access or data
breaches.
5. Provide features for file management such as viewing uploaded files, organizing files into categories or folders, and
deleting files when necessary.
6. Handle concurrent file access and manage file versions if multiple users are allowed to modify the same file.
7.lmplement error handling and feedback mechanisms to notify users of successful file uploads/downloads,
authentication failures, network errors, etc.

Text-to-Speech Application
we aim to develop a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input text and
convert it into speech. The application should provide options for adjusting speech parameters and support
multiple languages for enhanced usability.
Key Requirements:
1. Develop a GU I using Python's tkinter library to create an interactive interface for text input and speech
output.
2.1mplement text-to-speech (TTS) functionality using libraries like pyttsx3 or gTTS to convert the entered text
into speech.
3. Provide options for users to select different voices, adjust speech rate, pitch, volume, and other parameters
to customize the speech output.
4.1nclude support for multiple languages and accents to cater to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
5.1nclude playback controls such as play, pause, stop, and replay to manage the speech output effectively.
6.Allow users to save the generated speech as audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV) for offline use or sharing purposes.
7. Ensure user-friendly error handling and feedback mechanisms to notify users of any issues during text input
or speech generation.
